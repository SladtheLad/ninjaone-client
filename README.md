# NinjaOne Client React Showcase

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Open `.env.local` file and change the base URI to local or remote backend. Leave as is if locally serving on port 3000.

3. Run `npm run dev`.

4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

5. Enjoy!

## Usage

While general navigation and usage is mostly intuitive, I prefer apps being fully keyboard accessible and used `react-aria` components to get this level of accessibility out of the box.
Everything is tab and arrow key navigable.
